# BERT vs. DistilBERT Q&A System

This project develops a Question and Answering (Q&A) system to evaluate the performance of two prominent models, BERT and DistilBERT, using the A/B testing methodology. The goal is to determine which model is more effective and efficient for Q&A tasks, focusing on metrics such as accuracy, response time, and operational costs.

## Project Overview

The project employs Python and the Transformers library to implement and compare the BERT and DistilBERT models on a diverse dataset. The effectiveness of each model is measured through a structured A/B testing process, allowing us to identify the optimal model based on real-world performance metrics.

## Features

- **Model Implementation**: Setup and configuration of BERT and DistilBERT models.
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Infrastructure to conduct A/B testing between two models.
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques employed to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.
- **Cost Analysis**: Evaluation of operational costs associated with each model.
